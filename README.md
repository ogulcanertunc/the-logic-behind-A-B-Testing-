Implementing A / B Tests in Python  
  
A / B testing is one of the most important tools for optimizing most of the things we interact with on our computers, phones and tablets. From website layouts to social media ads and product features, every button, banner, and call to action likely passed A / B testing. And these tests can be extremely detailed.  
  
In this project, I will try to understand whether the new method or the old method is good with the data I have on the advertising method to be given by a company.
